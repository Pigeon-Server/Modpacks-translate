		"The Carpenter is similar to an Automatic Crafting Table, except it has a specific recipe set. For example, you aren't able to automatically craft Stone into Stone Bricks.",
		"",
		"The Carpenterâ€™s main task is the creation of Bog Earth, Humus (although there are methods to make these items without this machine, they aren't as efficient) and the [Crating] of some items and blocks for more compact storage.",
		"",
		"It is also used in the creation of the Beealyzer, Treealyzer and the various Woven Backpacks, among other machines, tools and items that are needed for Forestry and other mods."
